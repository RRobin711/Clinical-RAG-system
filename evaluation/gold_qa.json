    "answer": "The paper identifies several validated screening tools for common mental disorders:\n\n**For any CMD:** SRQ-20 (weighted DOR 28.36), GHQ-12 (weighted DOR 22.59), GHQ-5 (weighted DOR 59.82), K-6 (weighted DOR 15.61), K-10 (weighted DOR 15.55), GHQ-28 (weighted DOR 15.31), SSQ (weighted DOR 9.37), EPDS (weighted DOR 7.01).\n\n**For depressive disorders:** HADS-D (weighted DOR 33.07), PHQ-9 (weighted DOR 27.52), PHQ-2 (weighted DOR 22.18), BDI (weighted DOR 16.14), ZSDS (weighted DOR 36.47), GDS-15 (weighted DOR 31.97), CES-D (weighted DOR 18.79). **For postnatal depression:** EPDS (weighted DOR 148.68 for postnatal depression, 172.70 for postnatal major depressive disorder).\n\n**For anxiety disorders:** HADS-A (weighted DOR 60.09). The study identified validation studies for 25 different tools for any CMD, 63 different tools for depressive disorders, 11 tools for anxiety disorders, and 10 tools for PTSD across 153 studies corresponding to 273 separate validations.",

    "question": "How is the DSM-IV definition of severity applied to major depression diagnosis?",
    "answer": "The DSM-IV definition of severity for major depression is \"judged to be mild, moderate or severe based on the number of criteria symptoms, the severity of the symptoms and the degree of functional disability and distress.\" The three severity measures showed correlations that were significant but moderate: criteria count and syndromal impairment +0.25 (n=1005, p<0.0001), criteria count and symptom severity +0.37 (n=1015, p<0.0001), and syndromal impairment and symptom severity +0.40 (n=1005, p<0.0001). Factor analysis produced a single 'severity' factor, with moderate loadings: symptom severity (+0.75), syndromal impairment (+0.52) and criteria count (+0.51).",

    "question": "What methods are recommended for screening depression in adolescents?",
    "answer": "The paper recommends the WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the six-item version of Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-6) for screening depression in adolescents using a two-step procedure. For WHO-5, a score below 13 indicates poor well-being and need for depression testing, with sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.29 using cut-off <50. For BDI-6, conventional cut-off scores are <6 (no depression), 6-7 (mild depression), >7 (moderate depression), with sensitivity of 0.50 and specificity of 0.83 using cut-off <7.",

    "question": "What are the psychometric properties of the PHQ-4 for pregnant women?",
    "answer": "The PHQ-4 demonstrated good psychometric properties for pregnant women in this Spanish sample (n=845): Cronbach's alpha = 0.77 for the total PHQ-4, α = 0.70 for the PHQ-2 depression subscale, and α = 0.75 for the GAD-2 anxiety subscale. Confirmatory factor analysis showed excellent fit indices for a two-factor structure (RMSEA = 0.069, CFI = 0.99, NFI = 0.90), and construct validity was supported by strong intercorrelations with the PHQ-9 (r = 0.76, p < 0.01).",
